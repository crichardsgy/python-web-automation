- Add Gecko Webdriver to priv/ folders
- Add delimited content to dropfileshere/compile.txt
- Add images in sequential format (e.g. image1.png, image2.png, image3.png) (matches the compile order) (change file format in code if not a png)

Tip to obtain images from multiple documents:
- Use libreoffice to compile documents into master
- Save as DOCX
- Open DOCX as zip and find images folder
